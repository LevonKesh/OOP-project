# Levon's, Mariam's and Suren's DnD Game

This is a program written in Java, which using Java Swing, simulates a RPG game. Here is a guideline to help you get started to play it properly.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains several folders, where:

- `Battle`: the package with source code of battles
- `Databases`: the folder with databases of enemies, items and weapons used during the game
- `Entity`: the package that contains classes for all the entities of the game
- `GFX`: the folder with visuals
- `GUI`: the folder with GUI components
- `ItemsAndSpells`: the folder that contains classes for the items, weapons and spells

To run the code, compile the sources. The "Game.java" file contains the entry to the program, and starts the game.

## Starting Screen

Click "Start". Write down the name of the player. The game starts.

## Game Window

Enjoy the game!

The game is divided into two parts an investigation and text based part and battles.

During the investigation there is a text on the left side of the window that shows what is going on now.

At the same window there are several buttons on the right that show what you can do at the moment.

In the inventory menu you can use healing potions and change your weapon.

In the trade menu you can buy and sell items.

During the game some battles will commence. During them a battle window will appear.

To move just select your hero and click on the square on which you want to go. Available squares will be highlighted.

If you are next to the enemies you may hit them by just clicking on them.

On the right side there is a statusbar that shows current health of each unit present on the grid.

Thank you and good luck playing the game!
